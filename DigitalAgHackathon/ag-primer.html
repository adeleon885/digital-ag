            <p><strong>The Life Cycle of Food (for Developers)</strong></p>

        <section>
            <p class="intro"><strong>You know how to optimize code. This is the source code of the food
                    system.</strong><br>
                Agriculture is the original "full-stack" technology. To build effective digital solutions, you must
                understand the <strong>4 Stages of the Loop</strong>.</p>

            <h2>1. Inputs: The "Dependency Injection"</h2>
            <div class="stage-card">
                <p>Farmers are resource managers. They inject resources to maximize output while minimizing cost.</p>

                <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                    <img src="assets/images/IFSM.jpg" alt="IFSM Diagram" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                </div>

                <h3>💧 Water</h3>
                <p>One of the most critical variables. 70% of global freshwater goes to agriculture.</p>
                <div class="bug-alert">
                    <strong>🐛 The Bug:</strong> Over-irrigation wastes water and energy; under-irrigation kills yield. It is an optimization problem.
                </div>
                <br>

                <h3>🧪 Nutrients (N-P-K)</h3>
                <p>Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium. The "libraries" plants need to build cells.</p>
                <div class="bug-alert">
                    <strong>🐛 The Bug: "Drift"</strong>. In hydroponics, plants consume ions at different rates, unbalancing the solution. In soil, excess fertilizer washes away, polluting waterways (Runoff).
                </div>
                <br>

                <h3>🌱 Seeds</h3>

                <p>The "hardware" of the farm. Genetics determine the theoretical maximum yield limit.</p>
                <div class="bug-alert">
                    <strong>🐛 The Bug:</strong> Economies of scale mean that the same seeds are used for all farms. This limits the diversity of crops making them vulnerable to disease, and does not optimize for local conditions.
                </div>
                <br>

                <h3>🪱 Soil</h3>
                <p>Almost all human nutrition depends on the thin layer of soil that is vulnerable to erosion and degradation. Think of it as the <strong>Operating System</strong>—it manages the resources (water, nutrients) for the applications (plants).</p>
                <div class="bug-alert">
                    <strong>🐛 The Bug:</strong> Soil health and high yield intensity are often at odds.

            <h2>2. The Process: The "Black Box" (Growth)</h2>
            <div class="stage-card">
                <p>Once inputs are in, biology takes over. Your job is to monitor the runtime environment.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> The engine. Plants convert light + water + CO<sub>2</sub> into mass. The misconception: plants <em>do not</em> build their physical structure from the soil. </li>
                    <li><strong>Micro-Climates:</strong> A field isn't uniform. One corner might be wet, another dry.
                        Treating them the same is inefficient.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="bug-alert">
                    <strong>🐛 The Hackers (Pests & Disease):</strong>
                    Insects steal resources. Pathogens infect the system. Zoonoses are bugs that jump from animals to
                    humans (e.g., COVID-19).

            <h2>3. Harvest: The "Output"</h2>
            <div class="stage-card">
                <h3>Yield != Volume</h3>
                <p>Success isn't just "more stuff." It is "more <em>sellable</em> stuff."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cosmetic Filtering:</strong> "Ugly" fruit and vegetables (perfectly edible but misshapen) may be discarded or sold for low value applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing Window:</strong> Harvest too early? No flavor. Harvest too late? Rot. Labor shortages often mean crops rot in the field.</li>

        <section>
            <h2>4. The Supply Chain: The "Network"</h2>
            <div class="stage-card">
                <p>Getting the packet from Server (Farm) to Client (Plate) without data loss (Spoilage).</p>

                <h3>❄️ The Cold Chain</h3>
                <p>Keeping perishable food at the right temperature. A single "server outage" (power loss in a truck)
                    ruins the whole batch.</p>

                <h3>🗑️ The Waste Crisis (Packet Loss)</h3>
                <p><strong>30% of all food is wasted.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Developed World:</strong> Waste happens at the consumer end ("Best By" confusion).</li>
                    <li><strong>Developing World:</strong> Waste happens at the farm end (poor storage/roads).</li>
